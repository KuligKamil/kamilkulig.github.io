Dear Guys & GIrls, 
I need to do some confession
When I was young, something like 9-10 years old. I get trauma.
Teacher from native language tell my mom and me that
I will be never ever writer. I don't have talent for it.


AND NOW WHAT? WHAT YOU SAID BITCH!?

5 DAYS IN ROW!
I AM UNSTOPPABLE!

Guys.
Words hart. They could do more damage then phiscialy pain.
Look out what you saing.
Don't worry about what other said.
To the teacher not hard feelings. Now I understand. You were not good teacher.


## ideas

## challlenges
* first time work with XML in Python, now I remember why format change from XML to JSON
* I never remeber when write tests what is first: expected value or actual value
  * ** assert actual == expected**
  * TODO: write more tests!

``` python

def test_actual_expected():
    expected = 4
    actual = 2+1
    assert actual == expected

```
