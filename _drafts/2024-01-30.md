Dear Guys, 
I need to do some confession
When I was young, something like 9-10 years old. I get trauma.
Teacher from native language tell my mom and me that
I will be never ever writer.


AND NOW WHAT? WHAT YOU SAID BITCH!?

5 DAYS IN ROW!
I AM UNSTOPPABLE!

Guys.
Words hart. They could do more damage then phiscialy pain.
Look out what you saing.
Don't worry about what other said.
To the teacher not hard feelings. Now I understand. You were not good teacher.
