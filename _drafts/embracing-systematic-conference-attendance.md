Why Embracing Systematic Conference Attendance Is a Game-Changer

Pros:
* Get a lot of knowledge.

* If you are the fan to watch conference like me.
  Totally different experience than watch it from home. 
  It's like watch concert on youtube. 
  You don't get same vibe, energy, understating of problem, reaction from peoples.

* New countries, new people, travel the world

* The most important. People, people.
  Meet awesome people, Networking

* Easier to find new job. With bigger networking it's much easier to find new job.

* Remember You don't need to be expert with this technology.

* Always after conference I have better motivation for work.


Cons:
* ðŸ’µ Of course you need to have money. For transport, probably some accommodation. 
For ticket conference. But if you are speaker ( I could write another article for that), ticket is free. What I recommend.

I didn't check but what's going on now on the market, and a lot of [layoffs](https://layoffs.fyi/). 
It's harder to get sponsor for conference.


My list of conf in 2023:
* offline:
  * PyCon PL Gliwice
  * PyCon Sweden
  * DevAI by Data Science Summit 
* online:
  * Vue Forge 3&4

Definitely in next year will be more then 3!!!

If you have issues or any doubts to go to conference. Please share in comments or write private message.
I have hope I give you the reasons to go to conferences.
