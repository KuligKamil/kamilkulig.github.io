* A complete instrumentation guide in Python -  Manoj Pandey, Neeraj Pandey
  what toos they use: There is an entire spectrum of tools and processes to achieve application monitoring, observability, and telemetry for all your running apps. Where monitoring is an action you take, observability is an overall function or property of a system. The more you can observe a system, the more you can understand its complex ways. We no longer have to assume that various integrated services are a “black box” that we cannot see into. In this tutorial, we go through building a simple Python app and introduce “code instrumentation” as part of building observability and understanding the app's performance. We will finally see how this instrumentation is helpful to the developers and how can we visualise the final system using tools like Grafana etc.
