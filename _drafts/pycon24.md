* The snake of Theseus - Evolution of Python language - Pablo Galindo Salgado
  [youtube link to PyCon Ireland](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQDzaMYTkYU)
  
    As Python keeps evolving and attracts an ever-growing community with unique perspectives, steering council members and core developers face the enthralling challenge of preserving Python's fundamental identity. In this talk, we embark on a journey, exploring how Python retains its essence while evolving, accommodating new features, and embracing diverse viewpoints. From balancing innovation and compatibility, to navigating the maze of language design, we will discuss what fortifies Python against change and how we prepare to make complicated decisions that may change the language forever.

  to much, to fast,

* A complete instrumentation guide in Python -  Manoj Pandey, Neeraj Pandey
  what toos they use: There is an entire spectrum of tools and processes to achieve application monitoring, observability, and telemetry for all your running apps. Where monitoring is an action you take, observability is an overall function or property of a system. The more you can observe a system, the more you can understand its complex ways. We no longer have to assume that various integrated services are a “black box” that we cannot see into. In this tutorial, we go through building a simple Python app and introduce “code instrumentation” as part of building observability and understanding the app's performance. We will finally see how this instrumentation is helpful to the developers and how can we visualise the final system using tools like Grafana etc.

  not good workshop, but have preety legit repository
