presentations:
 
* The snake of Theseus - Evolution of Python language - Pablo Galindo Salgado
  [youtube link to PyCon Ireland](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQDzaMYTkYU)
  
    As Python keeps evolving and attracts an ever-growing community with unique perspectives, steering council members and core developers face the enthralling challenge of preserving Python's fundamental identity. In this talk, we embark on a journey, exploring how Python retains its essence while evolving, accommodating new features, and embracing diverse viewpoints. From balancing innovation and compatibility, to navigating the maze of language design, we will discuss what fortifies Python against change and how we prepare to make complicated decisions that may change the language forever.
