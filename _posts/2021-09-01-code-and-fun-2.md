# Code and Fun \#2

Every Tuesday, I meet with my colleagues to Code&Fun. This is a monthly links collection. 

Code&Fun:

* share code, code snippets - not only from work,
* brainstorming problems,
* share good practices,
* highlights from code reviews,
* share interesting articles & repositories.
