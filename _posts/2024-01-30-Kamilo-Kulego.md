Dear Guys, 

I have a confession to make.

When I was young, about 9-10 years old. I had a trauma, to write something.

Teacher from native language told my mom and me that

I will never be a writer.  "You don't have the talent."


AND NOW WHAT? WHAT YOU SAID BITCH!?

5 DAYS IN A ROW!

I AM UNSTOPPABLE!


Words can hurt. They can do more damage than physical pain.

Watch what you say.

Don't worry about what others have said.

No hard feelings towards the teacher. I understand now. You were not a good teacher.


## challlenges
* I went to bed too late again, 
* first time working with XML in Python, now I remember why the main format change from XML to JSON
* I can never remember what comes first when writing tests: expected value or actual value
  * ** assert actual == expected**
  * TODO: write more tests!

``` python

def test_actual_expected():
    expected = 4
    actual = 2+1
    assert actual == expected

```
