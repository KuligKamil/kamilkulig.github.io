  FastApi for the win <3
  
  A lot of fullstacks on the market :O

  I heard opinion "Do two jobs for he value of one." 

  Remember, fullstack it's not the meaning of that. Always you will be better on backend or on fronted.

  Just don't be scary of learn other technologies.

  Be more open, more varianty. Have fun with that.

  It will give you value in future. Maybe not today, not tomorrow. But trust me.
