# set goals that can't achive

Dear Readers

I did it 
I set goal to wake up at 7 & run
And I failed

Sorry, David Goggins

## ideas
* create to script for auto create whole week of branches for posts with template
* write every evening note what I did for daily, I mean reporty I mean blamly 

## challenges
* use js - let's face it, I AM NOT FRONTEND

## achievements
* find some solution for my issue on only add comment for blog, quick win, 

  not finished yet, but still W, link: [https://mrinalcs.github.io/jekyll-comments-using-google-forms](https://mrinalcs.github.io/jekyll-comments-using-google-forms)

  awesome but see some missing parts, ugly js, but my js is much uglier

* run, not at 7 AM but 7 PM, gravitation 1:0 Kamil
* build python package with pdm on send it for artifactory jfrog
* create girthub actions workflow on event, pull request validate with ruff & test
    
## learnings
* google forms are legit tool

* use pdm at work, awesome [https://pdm-project.org/en/latest/](https://pdm-project.org/en/latest/)
