The datamodel-code-generator project is a library and command-line utility to generate pydantic models from just about any data source, including:

OpenAPI 3 (YAML/JSON)
JSON Schema
JSON/YAML Data (which will converted to JSON Schema)
Swagger

Whenever you find yourself with any data convertible JSON but without pydantic models, this tool will allow you to generate type-safe model hierarchies on demand.
