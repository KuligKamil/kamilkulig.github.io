50, one cancel, in my opinion big lost (CANCELLED) What is terrible about Event Sourcing by Greg Young @Event Store. üò• \
The main star was Bjarne Stroustrup. He is a Danish computer scientist, most notable for the invention and development of the C++ programming language. The same time were another 4 peresentation. Honestly we could choose between 46 and we watch almost 20 presentation.
