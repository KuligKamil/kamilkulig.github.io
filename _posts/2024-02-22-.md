The best scrum master - my drfinition of scrum

As a developer and leader more than 6 years.
Review by Agnieszka and Marcin
Agile - we are agile , no you are not
Kanban - you are mean Kanbar?
Scrum - sram
* best scrum master , scrum master ninja, nobody see nobody hear  but assin when need
* Goal on review 
* Epic master prepare draft tasks
* Pre planning, everybody prepare his tasks
* On planning discuss with product owner details( max 30 minutes)
* Planing need to be only summary planning
* A lot of waist of time for whole team of course if team is too big for me it’s max 6 people
* Daily, not fucking daily, could be 3 times if team know each other
* With async - when all participants agree
* Scrum master is not developer, i hope i didn’t disagrees bible of scrum bogobojnych
* Retrospective- be honest, say bad words, chill, team need to be build on trust. Agree best on live
* After each issue on retro needs to have action with leader, best of it will be ob obard
* Board need to be automatize, people dobt neet to waist time
* for me noard need to have columns expected for transparancy, need to show whole developer or data science process

Create application for daily, super board,
better automation,
Easy to move from one task to another 
Alert about time, progress
Notes from daily, for people not could join
System that could recommend what to do next
What’s not working

Option to have one board for different tasks type


Roadmap like in github, different type on show on board

Support each pf member, developer at work on his estimation, problems, recommend what to do

Have ooo in option to show your capacity, easy add to mail, teams communication 

Shownalerts if somebody have some urgent, accident 

Optional - no accept some definiton of done- create task on backlog

Backlog cleaning


How grep tasks from jira


get your blog fast - with zero money
With markdown, gothub pages


Never panninc
As a leader you need to inspire its 24/7 
They always saw you and you have always masz wplyw na nich

Be catalyst


ayer, buen provecho

Wgat do You need? After each 1on1


People like plants
Some need more light
Some more water
Some need firizer? Cut?
