# Me gusta jugar a la "Siesta Roulette"

"It's hard to believe 

how far 

small steps can take you 

until you experience the progress 

for yourself.


Then it becomes 

hard to remember 

where it all started.


Keep going."

## learning 
* [AWS] Lambdas
  * You could use crontab expressions
  * Step Functions is a visual workflow service that helps developers use AWS services to build distributed applications, automate processes, orchestrate microservices, and create data and machine learning (ML) pipelines.
  
* [Pandas] usage log
  * read df from csv
  * check columns
  * drop couple columns
  * change types of 2 columns
  * concatenate 2 columns together
  * double check with group by count if all done correct
  * add id column 
  * apply uuid value to the column
  * set index with id 
  * write df to csv


```python 
# WIP need to change jupyther code to script python file

```


* [JupytherNotebook] Black works in vscode, pretty good.


## finds
* [AI] LangChain's flexible abstractions and extensive toolkit unlocks developers to build context-aware, reasoning LLM applications.
  
* low code or no code are good for prototyping
  * exmaple tool: Tablue a powerful data visualization tool that allows users to connect to various data sources and create interactive dashboards.

* [TOOLS] Obsidian
