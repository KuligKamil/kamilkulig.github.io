# Shine baby, shine

Dear Kamil, 

Remember that. 
* Success is a process not outcomes of goals. Focus on process.
  * But deviver staff.
* don't compare to others. 
  * But do your staff systematic
* get some balance.
  * Start move more. Come back for 1 hour walking a day. 
* if you stumble, miss some day of blog, get up!
Love,
KK

## ideas
* TODO: article: Why use ORMS are awesome 
  * (thanks chatgpt for couple some points, to get draftg),
  * But with examples with code 
    * Agenda:
      1. **Abstraction of Database Complexity:** ORMs provide a high-level abstraction over database operations, allowing data scientists to focus on analysis without dealing with intricate SQL queries.

      2. **Rapid Development:** ORMs expedite development by eliminating the need for manual SQL code, enabling data teams to iterate quickly on projects.

      3. **Code Maintainability:** ORMs enhance code readability and maintainability, as they use object-oriented programming principles, making it easier for data scientists to collaborate and understand each other's code.

      4. **Cross-Database Compatibility:** ORMs abstract away database-specific syntax, facilitating smoother transitions between different database systems and reducing compatibility issues for data science projects.

      5. **Query Optimization:** Some ORMs automatically optimize queries, aiding data scientists in writing efficient code without delving into the intricacies of query optimization.

      6. **Object-Relational Mapping:** ORMs map database tables to objects, providing a natural and intuitive way for data scientists to interact with and manipulate data within their programming language of choice.

      7. **Reduced Boilerplate Code:** ORMs reduce the amount of boilerplate code needed for database interactions, streamlining the development process for data science teams.

      8. **Integration with Frameworks:** Many ORMs seamlessly integrate with popular frameworks, simplifying the process of incorporating data science functionality into web applications or other software projects.

      9. **Version Control:** ORMs facilitate version control for database schema changes, enabling data teams to track and manage database modifications more efficiently.

      10. **Community Support:** Widely adopted ORMs often have large and active communities, providing data scientists with access to a wealth of resources, tutorials, and solutions to common challenges.

* TODO Use AI, chatgpt to help me on my write skillset in english

* TODO: better work on blog
  *  maybe create or find extension to show changes correct for example this sign "|" change change line in to table in jekyll engine 
  * maybe run blog locally
* TODO: create medium post
* TODO: create dev.to post
  
## challlenges
* day have only 24 hours
* It was hard to start working
* I work on Sunday
  * without any order 
  * out of a sense of duty 
  * of my own free and uncoerced will
  * I'm disappointed in myself
  * bad Kamil, bad
* I was good ligher today. "Are you shining for yourself or me? Yes"

## achievements
- [X] another day of blogging, 3!
- [X] write draft for article "Why Embracing Systematic Conference Attendance Is a Game-Changer"
- [X] [WORK] prepare for monday meeting about refactor code, plan it, create some summary, notes
  * prepare process, list of task when you refactor some code, 
    * first e2e test, if it's not enough do more, if you want to edit structure,
    * do integration for each endpoint 
      * by endpoint I mean some staff that we know what we give and what we get
    * now start refactor, try write code for 
  * maybe start to use ORM like SQLAlchemy? 
  * maybe too much OOP code, best is gold rule, to use some OOP and functionl
  * when use OOP, not use power of it, polymorphism, and design patterns
    * to find polimorphism find if-ology
      * not forget that could be overengineering,  
    * why we need main class? maybe we could do everything more functional?
    * easier to tests function if it's not on huge main class with a lot of attributes
    * easiet to tests function if haver clear in and out
  * not SOLID code
  * be more DRY, Don't Repeat Yourself, 
    * functions have arguments!, delete similar functions, maybe if, maybe polymorphism  
  * add more in readme, how to start use it, how to start develop it
  * add linter & code formater like ruff
    * solve many MY struggles to watch this code XD NAZI coder XD
  * get out of for's in pandas part of code
  * [SPIKE]columns like pandas class, enums, if name change, we will change in one place?
  * start to use Pokemon Exception Handling, "Pokemon - gotta catch 'em all!!!" 
  * are comments nessesary? 
    * maybe sometimes, maybe name of variables is not perfect, not fit
    * maybe add typing, mypy? alternative
      * in vscode, Inlay Type Hints https://devblogs.microsoft.com/python/python-in-visual-studio-code-july-2022-release/#inlay-type-hints
      * in pycharm, Inlay Hints https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/inlay-hints.html#enable_inlay_hints
  * don't use "from super_fantstic_lib import *"
  * prove_is_not_None_is_unessesary
