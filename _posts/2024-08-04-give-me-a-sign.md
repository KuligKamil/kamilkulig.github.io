## inspirations
* App create by Pandy Knight, htmx + fastapi + python
  
  Worth mentioning that application show example to test complete application. From unit, integration & e2e tests. <3

  One of talk when he present application "Full-Stack Python" on PyTexas 2023

  Probably we will create application (with Adam) in PyCon PL 2024 on MongoDB workshop with similar tech.
  It will be much easier, more efficient if we could do both backend and frontend.
