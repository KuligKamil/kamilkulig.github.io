# STEP TWO

## ideas

* write script for grep each learning from posts in github actions, group by type of learning
* write script automation create new file + use template, use python + typer
* TODO: analyze & fix my english speking, use pandas
  * copy captions from youtube video from GraphQl https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF7fx5BjGw0&ab_channel=PyConPL
* [?] maybe habits tracking, sleep, clean food, activity on this blog?
* TODO: add google analytics for blog on github pages https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17207458/how-to-add-google-analytics-tracking-id-to-github-pages
* article: why I need this blog?
  * more then blog, 
  * easier catch Up data about learnings, to  not forget one sink, 
  * for work and interview
  * for motivation others
  * for motivation myself
    * wonders
      * age ( I know I'm still young )
      * remote work
      * burnout ( what I get some time ago, but it's looks like I get back on track üí™ )
      * change position, from february
      * not manager, any more, 
  * to check progress after some time
  * for build statue, leave something legacy on earth for later generations
  * materials, for bigger post, presentation, conference
* maybe add linter for my blog posts, extentions in vscode or rust script ü¶Ä

## challlenges

* get up before 10, 10:08 üò¥
* never ever use notes on github website, use vscode & commit faster text for blog, bcs you couold lost 1 hour work like me today üò≠üò≠üò≠

## learning 

### [PANDAS] tips&tricks to check, TODOs

* open always documentation, a lot of libs, could learn from pandas
* how work .loc, iloc, example they return views, not data copies 
* not use loops (key words: for, while ), in pandas better write functional code
  * chainging, reduce, filter, map, apply(lambda), assign, pipe, iter_row
* try this link https://github.com/Yorko/mlcourse.ai/blob/main/jupyter_english/topic01_pandas_data_analysis/topic1_pandas_data_analysis.ipynb

### [PRESENTATION] I found that PyCon PL. Share records from last edition.

Conclusions! 
* I need work more on public speach, bcs it's heard I am sooo nervous
* could train more for this presentation, 
* sleep better day before
* my English is not on acceptable level. TODO: analyze with code, go to some lessons, more network on discord & at work

* Kamil Kulig - How to share links, Lighting talk https://youtu.be/Utxa8WyY-Ro?si=QZhcAtWwr99mwTHP&t=1887
  
### [Python] imports, packages, modules, namespaces

 * what is the diffrence between "import a" and "from a import b" 
 * why "from a import *" is wrong practice
 * why use key word "as"
 * diff between packages vs modules

### [MARKDOWN] always forget how to do checkbox in markdown

"- [ ]" = empty checkbox

"- [X]" = done checkbox
