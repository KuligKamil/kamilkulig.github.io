# Summary of 2024

It's the beginning of February, which is the perfect time to summarize 2024. XD
I would love to share with you my achievements and failures (opportunities) from the past year. 
For me, it's a good way to work on my imposter syndrome.

## Achievements

Speaker: "MongoDB for Beginners" & "Getting Started with Copier" at Python Summit, Warsaw.

### Books 
 
Almost consume almost 10 books in English. God Bless Audiobooks

## Health

## Failures - Challenges - Opportunities - Staff to work on
* Sleep. On average, I sleep for 6 hours and 47 minutes, with a bedtime of 2:44 AM and a wake-up time of 9:31 AM.

* I didn't finished my side projects. I need to have something in production. Take less, do more.

* I didn't write on this blog as much as I wanted.

* Imposter Syndrome. It's blocking me to do more.

Thanks for reading this ❤️

Love,
