# The last day as a Leader

Dear Team.

Today is my officially the last day as a leader of the wonderful people, the last they as Fullstack Developer Leader.

The main reason why I want to leave the role of the leader was the lack of development, miss programming, the pressure and the conditions in which the meetings were held. 

For my mental state and not to get depression I resign. 
Maybe I was too weak, too transparent or too team-oriented. But I don't regret my decisions or sometimes show my weakness.
Just look at my team and how much they have developed. What positions they get after working with me.

I didn't lose, but I grew up with this decision. It was not easy.

One of my colleagues told me that he once tried a very similar role and he will never do it again. 

I didn't understand at the beginning. 

But now I do. After more than 2 years I understand. It's more than work. It's a huge responsibility.

GUYS! Respect for every good leader who works, tries the best for his people, colleagues & company.

About good leaders & first person I want to thank, the person I own a lot.


Michal Korzycki, without you, your example, your wisdom, lessons, your patience with me I will never be what I am now.

Thank you for putting up with me, feedbacks, support, push & giving me the opportunity to share a part of your IT journey with you.

I always:
* try to be a servant leader. Of course, I have never been perfect. But I hope you will notice that I have always tried.
* had a dream to create a place where people want to work, grow & add value to the company.


**Remember that my phone, my mail, my home and my heart has always been, is and will always be open for you.**
